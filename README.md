### Market Basket Analysis
- Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. 
- It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.
### Association Rule Mining
- Association rule mining is a type of unsupervised learning technique used for data mining that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable. 
- It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables of dataset. Ap
### Apriori Algorithm
- The primary objective of the apriori algorithm is to create the association rule between different objects. 
- The association rule describes how two or more objects are related to one another. 
- Apriori algorithm is also called frequent pattern mining. 
- It assumes that
  - all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori property).
  - if an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.
